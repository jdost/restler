# TODO

This is just a list of some thoughts on things that I want to add/do with this
stuff.  (Most of this stuff will become issues in the repo)

* Make better forms of the error handling with both error codes and exceptions
* Expand test coverage for various scenarios
* Add some more rich datatypes and mimetypes
* Expand the test server to generate cookies and different status codes
* Maybe give the `Response` comparison magic methods for status codes ?
* Write some tests to handle the full application (write a fake handler)

## Uses

* Github
* Flickr
* Twitter
* Workhammer
* Tamari
