# TODO

This is just a list of some thoughts on things that I want to add/do with this
stuff.  (Most of this stuff will become issues in the repo)

* Build out the handlers for various status codes (3xx)
* Make better forms of the error handling with both error codes and exceptions
* Expand test coverage for various scenarios
* Add some more rich datatypes and mimetypes
* Look into `xmltodict` for XML handling
* Check how well XML works as the body of the request
* Fix issue with a non root URL versus the URL handling (root URLs get botched)
* Expand the test server to generate cookies and different status codes
* Add support for the `Link` header with relative paging
* Maybe give the `Response` comparison magic methods for status codes ?
* Write some tests to handle the full application (write a fake handler)
* Add file uploading support ?
* Add caching ?
